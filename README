Orthanc - A Lightweight, RESTful DICOM Server
=============================================


General Information
===================

This repository contains the integration tests that are used to
validate Orthanc before each official release, in complement to the
unit tests that are part of the Orthanc repository. These integrations
tests should be run by the package maintainers of the various
platforms supported by Orthanc.

General information about Orthanc can be found on its official
Website: http://www.orthanc-server.com/


Running the tests
=================

The integration tests are written in Python and are started by the
"./Tests/Run.py" script. The tests will validate a "remote" instance
of Orthanc (whose AET is "ORTHANC") that is assumed to be running
before the tests are started. To test the DICOM protocol, a second,
"local" instance of Orthanc is automatically started by the
integration tests (its AET is "ORTHANCTEST"). This situation is
depicted on the following illustration:

+--------------------------+             +-----------------------+
| Local computer           |             | Remote computer       |
+--------------------------+    HTTP     +-----------------------+
|                          | 5000 : 8042 |                       |
| Run.py <---> ORTHANCTEST <=============> ORTHANC               |
|                          | 5001 : 4242 |                       |
+--------------------------+    DICOM    +-----------------------+


1. Configure the remote Orthanc
-------------------------------

To run the integration tests, you first have to create a configuration
file for the remote instance of Orthanc. This is done by running the
"./GenerateConfigurationForTests.py" script on the *local*
computer. This script will autodetect the proper network parameters.
For instance (a help is available):

# ./GenerateConfigurationForTests.py --force

This will create the "./IntegrationTestsConfiguration.json"
configuration file that must be copied to the remote computer. Then,
start Orthanc on the remote computer with this configuration file.

By default, the configuration file will use "ORTHANC" as the AET, 8042
as the HTTP port, and 4242 as the DICOM port. You can of course
adapt these parameters by editing the generated configuration file,
if you have special constraints or if the autodetection fails.
